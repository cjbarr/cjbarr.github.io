  <h2>My Background</h2>
  <p> After obtaining a degree in English from my dream school, I served four years in the United States Coast Guard. After traveling the world, I realized I wanted to take my passion for empathy-based problem solving into the field of my childhood dreams: Technology. I hope to use my professional background in customer service to better create software solutions for issues facing every-day individuals.</p>
